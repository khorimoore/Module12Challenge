# React Profile Application

The **React Profile Application** is a responsive and professional portfolio website built using React and Bootstrap. It is designed to showcase key projects related to **AI**, **Nanotechnology**, **Bionics**, and **Private Apps** . All technologies heavily leveraged by programming, or vice-versa.

The portfolio reflects my journey as a developer and technologist, showcasing both the progress Iâ€™ve made and the areas I plan to specialize in for future innovations.
